DSC80 project: Analyzing Total Fat Content In Relation To Recipe Ratings

# Recipes and Ratings: Total Fat Content and Recipe Ratings
**Mihir Vad**

## Introduction

This project investigates whether the time it takes to prepare a recipe influences its saturated fat content. Saturated fat is linked to heart disease, and processed foods â€” often fast or overly complex â€” are high in it. Using real recipe and review data from Food.com (2008â€“2018), we explore relationships between prep time and nutritional health, clean the data, analyze trends, test hypotheses, and build a predictive model for saturated fat content.

## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

We cleaned and prepared the dataset by:
- Merging recipes and reviews
- Converting `nutrition` into separate columns
- Replacing invalid ratings (0s) with `NaN`
- Removing outliers in calories and minutes
- Adding features like `n_ingredients` and discretized prep time

### ðŸ“Š Distribution of Saturated Fat

Saturated fat follows a left-skewed distribution, centered around 20â€“30% of daily value, with some very high outliers.

### ðŸ“ˆ Prep Time vs Saturated Fat

Thereâ€™s a weak upward trend: recipes with longer prep times tend to have more saturated fat, possibly due to oil-heavy methods like frying or roasting.

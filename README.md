DSC80 project: Analyzing Total Fat Content In Relation To Recipe Ratings

# Recipes and Ratings: Total Fat Content and Recipe Ratings
**Mihir Vad**

## Introduction

This project analyzes recipe and review data from Food.com to explore and model what influences a recipe‚Äôs rating. The core goal is to predict a recipe's rating based on its ingredients, review, and nutritional value.

The motivation behind this question is simple but powerful: can we determine whether total fat content influences how highly a recipe is rated? Given the  online social presence for cooking platforms, this seeks to help users look through healthy eating options.

Datasets Used
We work with two datasets:

1. Recipes Dataset (83,782 entries)
|Column	                 |Description|
|---                     |---        |
|`'name'	`            |Recipe Name|
|`'id'`	                 |Recipe ID|
|`'minutes'`	         |Time to Prepare Recipe in Minutes|
|`'contributor_id'`	     |User ID for Recipe Uploader|
|`'submitted'`	            | Date of Recipe Submission|
|`'tags'`	              |Food.com Tags for Recipe|
|`'nutrition'`	          |List of Nutrition Information in the form [calories (#), total fat (PDV), sugar (PDV), sodium (PDV), protein    (PDV), saturated fat (PDV), carbohydrates (PDV)]; PDV meaning ‚Äúpercentage of daily value‚Äù|
|`'n_steps'`	          |Total Steps in a Recipe|
|`'steps'`	              |Recipe Steps, in order|
|`'description'`	     | User-provided description|
2. Interaction Dataset (Reviews) (731,927 entries)
|Column|Description|
|---|---|
|`'user_id'`	|User ID|
|`'recipe_id'`	|Recipe ID|
|`'date'`	|Date of Review|
|`'rating'`	|Rating|
|`'review'`	|Review Text|

After merging, the combined dataset contains 234,429 rows of recipes with corresponding reviews and ratings. The columns I mainly focused on were total fat (PDV) and rating.

We also explore this relationship through hypothesis testing and a predictive model that estimates a recipe‚Äôs rating based on its fat content and other features.

## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

We cleaned and prepared the dataset by:
- Merging recipes and reviews
- Converting `nutrition` into separate columns
- Replacing invalid ratings (0s) with `NaN`
- Removing outliers in calories and minutes
- Adding features like `n_ingredients` and discretized prep time

### üìä Distribution of Saturated Fat
<iframe src="assets/ratings_dist.html" width="800" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Saturated fat follows a left-skewed distribution, centered around 20‚Äì30% of daily value, with some very high outliers.

### üìà Prep Time vs Saturated Fat

There‚Äôs a weak upward trend: recipes with longer prep times tend to have more saturated fat, possibly due to oil-heavy methods like frying or roasting.

### üìã Pivot Table: Rating vs Fat and Minutes

```markdown
| Rating | Minutes | Saturated Fat (sat_fat) |
|--------|---------|--------------------------|
| 1.0    | 99.67   | 46.68                    |
| 2.0    | 98.02   | 42.88                    |
| 3.0    | 87.50   | 40.08                    |
| 4.0    | 91.58   | 36.43                    |
| 5.0    |106.92   | 39.23                    |
